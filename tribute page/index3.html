          <h2>THE MOST BRILLIANT THEORETICAL PHYSICISTS IN HISTORY</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Stephen William Hawking </b> (8 January 1942 – 14 March 2018) was an English theoretical physicist, 
            cosmologist, and author who, at the time of his death, was director of research at the Centre for Theoretical Cosmology 
            at the University of Cambridge.Between 1979 and 2009, he was the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the 
            University of Cambridge, widely viewed as one of the most prestigious academic posts in the 
            <br>
            <br>
            Hawking was born in Oxford into a family of physicians. In October 1959, at the age of 17, he began his university education 
            at University College, Oxford, where he received a first-class BA degree in physics. In October 1962, he began his graduate 
            work at Trinity Hall at the University of Cambridge where, in March 1966, he obtained his PhD degree in applied mathematics 
            and theoretical physics, specialising in general relativity and cosmology. In 1963, at age 21, Hawking was diagnosed with an 
            early-onset slow-progressing form of motor neurone disease that gradually, over decades, paralysed him. After the loss 
            of his speech, he communicated through a speech-generating device initially through use of a handheld switch, and eventually by 
            using a single cheek muscle.

            Hawking's scientific works included a collaboration with Roger Penrose on gravitational singularity theorems in the framework of 
            general relativity, and the theoretical prediction that black holes emit radiation, often called Hawking radiation. Initially, 
            Hawking radiation was controversial. By the late 1970s and following the publication of further research, the discovery was widely 
            accepted as a major breakthrough in theoretical physics. Hawking was the first to set out a theory of cosmology explained by a union 
            of the general theory of relativity and quantum mechanics. He was a vigorous supporter of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum 
            mechanics.
